The vast ocean of custom nodes can be intimidating for many.

We needed a definitive, central place to look up what a node does without deciphering complex code or watching long videos.

So, I built it.

I'm thrilled to introduce a new community resource, designed to be the ultimate plugin encyclopedia:

**ðŸ‘‰ [https://plugin.aix.ink](https://plugin.aix.ink)**

This isn't just a small collection of tutorials. It's a massive, searchable database built with one mission: **to make every ComfyUI node understandable to everyone.**

**âœ¨ What makes this different?**

*   ### **Massive Scope: 2000+ Plugins Documented**
    Yes, you read that right. I have systematically documented over **two thousand** individual custom nodes. If you're wondering what a node does, the answer is likely here.

*   ### **So Simple, a Child Could Understand It**
    This is not an exaggeration. Every explanation is written in the plainest language possible, avoiding jargon. The goal is clarity above all else. We break down *what it is*, *what it does*, and *how to use it* in the simplest terms.

*   ### **Visual and Searchable**
    The entire site is built around a fast, powerful search. Just type the name of a node, and you'll get its "manual page" instantly, complete with visuals and clear descriptions.

*   ### **For the Community, By the Community**
    This is a passion project. It's 100% free, has zero ads, and will be continuously updated to keep up with the ecosystem.
